					<div class="text-block">
						<h4 class="faqheading noextramargin">How can potential investors participate in Moeda crowdsale?</h4>
						<p>Investors can participate in Moeda crowdsale through our partners: <a class="link" href="https://bitcoinsuisse.ch">Bitcoin Suisse AG</a>, <a class="link" href="https://icoage.com">ICOage</a></p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">I'm so hesitant to join Moeda crowdsale via Bitcoin Suisse. It requires all my id and residency. I feel like I might be chased by the tax department.</h4>
						<p>Bitcoin Suisse AG is regulated by the self-regulatory organization the VQF (The Financial Services Standards Association), on behalf of the FINMA(Swiss Financial Market Authority). It really is no different than any other financial institution. KYC and AML are required  for financial service providers. </p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">How many coins are for sale and how much money are you looking for?</h4>
						<p>There are 20,000,000 MDA in total and they are all for sale. The team does not hold coins. We have already allocated 5,000,000 coins to pre-crowdsale private investors and we are about to raise $15,000,000 from the public. </p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">What does fiat pegged to Moeda token mean?</h4>
						<p>The in app token for investment will be pegged to fiat currency. Tokens are converted to fiat when used in a project at the market price. The crowdsale token is also pegged daily to around US$1 to avoid problems with volatility. The value of MDA is only US$1 during the crowdsale and later it fluctuates according to market demand?</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">What are you gonna do with the unsold coins?</h4>
						<p>We will burn all unsold tokens. The company will not hold any foundation tokens, instead, it has to buy back tokens in the market if it wants to have any.</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">When will crowdsale investors receive the coin?</h4>
						<p>We are having our contract reviewed by the third party and we plan to distribute MDA no longer than one month after the crowdsale.</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">When and on which exchanges will Moeda be traded?</h4>
						<p>This is confidential before the end of the crowdsale. We plan to have MDA tradable right after distributing the tokens to investors. </p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">What’s the problem Moeda is solving for?</h4>
						<p>Moeda is here to solve the problems of the lack of transparency and accessibility in impact investing, inaccessibility to capital for underbanked populations and entrepreneurs, inefficiency and high fees in traditional banking services, and the lack of identity for massive population in the world. </p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">Why do you incorporate in Uruguay?</h4>
						<p>Uruguay’s Free Trade Zone gives us the operational flexibility to straddle the real world and the digital world. We are encouraged by the Uruguayan government’s business-friendly environment and we have many advantages, including tax exemptions, unfettered foreign currency trading and logistical support. Also, the introduction and trade of foreign currency, gold, precious metals, and public values, is completely free. Payment and collection of commercial transactions do not require the intervention of any economic authority, including the Central Bank of Uruguay. Moeda plans to maximize its use by being established in free-trade zones in Uruguay and other countries to improve the overall trade efficiency of its clients and partner organizations.</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">Who are your banking partners? </h4>
						<p>Currently, we have Unicafes and Cresol as our banking partners. The cooperative entities Unicafes and Cresol have combined 700000 associates in more than 1100 cooperatives and are for 30 years providing micro-financing and financial services for small family farmers in Brazil. Under Unicafes umbrella Moeda is directly working with 170 Brazilian Cooperative Credit Banks and 128 Communitarian Banks to give mobile banking and access to capital for sustainable development projects.</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">So Moeda will have 100k customers on the platform?</h4>
						<p>Yes, we will start with 100k banking client resources that our partner bank has given us.  And we believe as long as we focus on building our product, millions of clients will come to us. At the same time, we will also be working on partnering with more banks in Brazil.</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">How do you select seed projects and who will evaluate them?</h4>
						<p>We will cooperate with ambassadors composed of government officers, international NGO like Green cross and local community leaders to evaluate every project based on our impact formula. Only those projects fit our social impact goal will be selected. </p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">What’s the lending period and what is the expected return?</h4>
						<p>The lending period varies from two months to one year, the expected return should be between 0% to 15% excluding fees charged by Moeda platform. </p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">When do you plan to go live with your first seed project?</h4>
						<p>We have selected our first seed project from 3000 potential candidates and the project will start in August 2017.</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">How to track my investment?</h4>
						<p>Moeda gives investors real-time transparency of SDG-aligned Impact Investment through periodic reports. Loans and donations to projects will be tracked transparently with a blog where investors can see pictures and videos of their investments in action and even discuss or give supporting words to the project. Meanwhile, the trust of cryptographically assured blockchain records and contracts.</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">Is there currently an MVP of the product?</h4>
						<p>MVP is in development but we have a demo app that we can show people.</p>

						<h4 class="faqheading">What investors can do with MDA?</h4>
						<p>Investors can trade MDA on exchanges where MDA is listed,  invest MDA in projects on our platform and gain interests. Also we are negotiating with payment solution providers and  investors may be able to top up their Visa / Mastercard debit card with MDA.</p>
